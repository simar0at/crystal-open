<p>By default, the concordance lines are shown in the same order as they are found in the corpus. The shuffle tool changes the order randomly.</p>
<p>Applying the shuffle tool on the same concordance will always produce the same new order of lines. This behaviour is intentional so that different users (e.g. students) can follow the same steps and arrive at the same result. Applying the shuffle tool twice or more times will also produce the same result as long as the other user applies the shuffle the same number of times.</p>
