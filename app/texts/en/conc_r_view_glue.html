<p><b>What is glue?</b></p>
<p>As a standard, %[token|tokens]% are always displayed with a space between them. However, this is not always normal. For example, a full stop or question mark at the end of a sentence do not normally have a space before them. In such cases, special corpus structure called <b>glue</b> and marked &lt;g/&gt; is inserted to tell Sketch Engine not to display the space in the concordance. Similarly, <em>don't</em> consists of two tokens: <em>do</em> and <em>n't</em>. Uncheck to display the space between.</p>
<p>Glue is used purely for display purposes. It has no other function. The &lt;g/&gt; structure can, however, be used in CQL searches if there is a use for it.</p>
