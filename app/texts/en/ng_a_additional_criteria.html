<p>The options with <b>…letters </b>work at character level, they check if he sequence of characters appears anywhere in the n-gram including inside the %[token|tokens]%. The options with <b>…words</b> work at %[token]% level, they check if the whole word appears between spaces in the n-gram.</p>
<p><b>all</b><br />no additional filtering will be applied</p>
<p><b>starting with letters</b><br />type a sequence of letters which each n-gram should have at the beginning, spaces can be included</p>
<p><b>ending with letters</b><br />type a sequence of letters which each n-gram should have at the end, spaces can be included</p>
<p><b>containing letters</b><br />type a sequence of letters which each n-gram should have at the beginning, in the middle or at the end, spaces can be included</p>
<p><b>starting with word</b><br />type a word that should be the first word (or token) of each n-gram, typing <em>cat</em> will include n-grams with <em>cat</em> but not with <em>catalogue</em></p>
<p><b>containing word</b><br />type a word that should appear anywhere in the n-gram including the first and last positions</p>
<p><b>ending with word</b><br />type a word that should appear as the last word of the n-gram</p>
<p><b>matching regular expressions</b><br />use %[regex|regular expressions]% for detailed filtering, the whole n-gram is treated as a continuous sequence of characters</p>
<p><b>from this list</b><br />type the n-grams to find out how frequently they appear in the currently selected corpus, the n-gram size must match the size selected above, a space must appear between all tokens, e.g. <em>I do n't know</em> or <em>he 'll go</em></p>
