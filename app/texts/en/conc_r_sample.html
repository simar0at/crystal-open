<p>When working with a large concordance, random sample is used to reduce the number of concordance lines while preserving the representativeness of the sample. &nbsp;The number of lines defined by the user will be randomly selected from all parts of the corpus.</p>
<p>The lines will stay in the same order as they appear in the corpus.</p>
<p>A random sample with the same number of lines generated from the same concordance will always produce <b>exactly the same</b> concordance lines. This behaviour is intentional so that different users (e.g. students) can follow the same steps and arrive at the same result. To generate a different sample, a different number should be used. Setting the value to 201 instead of 200 will generate a completely different sample.</p>
