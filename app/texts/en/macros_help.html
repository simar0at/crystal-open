Macros let you automate actions applied to a concordance. When they are saved as a macro, Sketch Engine will carry them out automatically. A saved macro can be selected on the concordance input form before each serach or it can be selected permanently to be applied on all subsequent concordances. See this short <a href="https://youtu.be/310MNBa8HSU" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>.
