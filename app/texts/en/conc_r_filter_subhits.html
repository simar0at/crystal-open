<p>By default, if the search query matches tokens inside another result, the line will be displayed twice. For example, this CQL  "J.*"{1,3}"N.*"(default attribute: tag) finds a noun preceded by 1, 2 or 3 adjectives and it will find <em>little black dress</em> but also <em>black dress</em>. Both results will be included in the concordance even though one is found inside the other. Hide sub-hits will only display the longer result: <em>little black dress</em>.</p>
