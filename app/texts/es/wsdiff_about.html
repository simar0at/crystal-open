<div>The word sketch difference is designed for making comparisons by contrasting
    <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/collocation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collocations</a>. Three options are available:
</div>
<ul class="browser-default">
    <li>
        <b>lemma</b> - compares the use of two different lemmas via their %[collocate|collocates]%
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>word forms</b> - compares the use of two different word forms of the same lemma via their collocates
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>subcorpora</b> - compares the use of the same lemma in two different %[subcorpus|subcorpora]% of the same corpus via their collocates
    </li>
</ul>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <div>The collocates of a word give a good idea about how the word is used: about subsenses, subject area, connotations or register. Comparing the collocations will provide a great insight into the difference in use and meaning. The word sketch difference makes the comparison more effective by automatically generating both word sketches and highlighting the collocates that make the difference.</div>

        <div class="collapsible-header">How does it work?</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <div>Sketch Engine assigns a colour to each search word (or a subcorpus) and generates the two word sketches. Then it compares the collocates in each
                <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/grammatical-relation/" target="_blank">grammatical relation</a> separately.
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>The colours indicate the search word (or a subcorpus) where the collocate is more typical or stronger. The shade of the colour indicates the strength of the collocation.&nbsp;The neutral colour in the centre marks collocates without a preference of a green or red word or a subcorpus.</div>
        </div>

    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header">The score</div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <div>The score is the
                <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/logdice/" target="_blank">logDice score</a> used in the word sketch. The collocates in word sketch difference are sorted by the differences in the scores. The collocates with a high difference are placed at the ends of the grammatical relation (red or green), the collocates with a small difference appear in the centre (neutral colour).

            <br>
            <div>The user can use the view options to display the %[frequency|frequencies]%&nbsp;and scores. Clicking the local menu will use the selected collocate as the search word of the other tools.</div>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <div>Use the icons in the header of each column to reorder, close and display the columns again. Use the icons next to each collocate to display the collocates in context as a concordance. To focus on only one column, use the icon which will hide all the remaining columns with one click. Hover the mouse over the icons to display tooltips which explain their functions.</div>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <div>Rich word sketches with lots of collocates in all grammatical relations are important. Therefore the requirements are the same as those for the word sketch.</div>
