                <b>Keywords</b>
                <br />Keywords are individual words (%[token|tokens]%) which appear more frequently in the
                <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/focus-corpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus corpus</a> than in the
                <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/reference-corpus-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference corpus</a>. Any %[token]% can qualify for a keyword if it is used more frequently in the focus corpus than in the reference corpus. In reality, the result will include mainly nouns and adjectives because the frequencies of other parts of speech tend to be similar in all texts.

                <b>Terms</b>
                <br />Terms are multi-word expressions which appear more frequently in the focus corpus than in the reference corpus and, additionally, match the typical format of terminology in the language. The format is defined in the
                <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/term-grammar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term grammar</a>.

            <div>Terminology extraction extracts words which are typical of the topic of the document or corpus, i.e. they appear in the corpus more frequently than they would in general language. A large non-specialized corpus in the language is used to represent general language.
                <br />The default settings are normally sufficient for the extraction to provide high-quality results.

The difference is that the user may not only be interested in specialized lexis which is rare in general language but sometimes it might be interesting to look which medium-frequency words or even high-frequency words are used more often than in general language.

                <br />Keywords and terms can be used to compare two corpora or subcorpora. When comparing subcorpora, they can both be in the same or different corpus.
                <br />The result will show what is typical of the focus (sub)corpus in comparison with the reference (sub)corpus.
